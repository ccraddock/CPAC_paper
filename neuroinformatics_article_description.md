Software Original Article - full length scientific manuscript describing a software product, clearly different from the user manual. This article type is fully referenced and abstracted, peer reviewed by usually three outside reviewers, and must describe a new software product or a significant extension of functionality. The software and script or code used to generate Figures and Tables should be made available to reviewers for evaluation and the software should be publicly available at the time of publication. The manuscript includes a short description of how to install and run it, a validation of its exactness according to accepted standards and an evaluation of its advantages to comparable software packages, including benchmarking if applicable.
